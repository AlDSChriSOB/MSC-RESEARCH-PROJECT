# MSC-RESEARCH-PROJECT
The project titled "Diurnal Patterns of Sentiments: A Time-based Sentiment Analysis of Tweets Across the Globe" investigates the relationship between time of day and human sentiment expression on the global Twitter platform. It employs advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and attention mechanisms, to analyze temporal sentiment trends across diverse global locations.

The study uncovers a consistent diurnal pattern in Twitter sentiment, revealing heightened positivity in the morning, peaking at 1 a.m., and increased negativity in the evening, reaching its peak at 4 p.m. Additionally, there is a gradual rise in pessimism over time, possibly influenced by external factors. These findings have broad implications across various domains, including business, governance, mental health, and technology.

Key contributions of the research include achieving an impressive 98% accuracy in sentiment classification with the LSTM hybrid model and providing valuable insights into the evolving nature of human emotions in the digital age. The study's methodology encompasses data collection from a diverse range of global locations, data preprocessing, supervised and unsupervised learning approaches, and time-based sentiment analysis.

The project's findings offer actionable insights for businesses to strategically time content delivery, policymakers to align decisions with public sentiment, and mental health practitioners to aid in mood disorder detection. Furthermore, the study suggests avenues for future research, such as expanding analysis to other social media platforms, incorporating additional features like user demographics and content context, and exploring the impact of external factors on sentiment patterns.

In conclusion, this project contributes significantly to sentiment analysis, temporal dynamics, and social media research, demonstrating the efficacy of advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms in uncovering hidden sentiment patterns within large-scale datasets. It provides valuable insights into the temporal nature of human emotions in the digital sphere, which can inform decision-making processes and drive innovation across various domains.
